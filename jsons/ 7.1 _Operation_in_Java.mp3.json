Whenever an operation is performed, it has 2 major components. The first one is Operands, i.e. who did we add, subtract, multiply, etc. Operands are a and b. The second major component of an expression is Operator. Operator is the symbol that tells us which operation is being performed. Here, since addition operation is being performed, so plus sign is the operator. We could have written difference as a minus b. Here, a and b are Operands and minus sign is the operator. Operators are similar to Maths operators in Java. Operators are the symbols in Java that tell the compiler which operation should be performed. For example, plus tells the compiler that we should add. Here, a minus b tells the compiler that we should subtract. Here, a multiplied by b tells us that we should multiply.
